# Speculative Attack Thesis

We all know very well that 99% of the projects in the crypto space are overvalued. The question is, how can we profit from this? The answer is simple: speculative attacks.

Many projects will try and sell you on their vision, their technology, and their team. But the truth is, most of them are just smoke and mirrors. They have no real utility, no real use case, and no real value. They are simply overvalued. This is not to say that all projects are bad, or malicious, simply that they are overvalued.

Is tesla a bad company? No. Is it overvalued? One could argue that it is. The same goes for many projects in the crypto space. They may have a great team, a great vision, and a great product, but that doesn't mean they are worth what they are currently valued at.

## Danger of Speculative Attacks

Speculative attacks are not without risk. They are high-risk, high-reward plays that require a deep understanding of the market, the project, and the risks involved. If you are not careful, you could lose everything. That being said, if you are smart, strategic, and patient, you could make a lot of money.

## The key is Beta (₿,β)

Beta is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Here what you want to avoid is getting caught in a beta trap. A beta trap is when you are exposed to the systematic risk of the market, and not the idiosyncratic risk of the project.

This is why it's important to choose your collateral wisely. You want to be able to short a project without being exposed to the market risk. If you are short and alt coin and the crypto market goes up, you could be in trouble. This is why it's important to be long on the market, and short on the project. To do this properly you need to be able to short the project, and go long on the market / bitcoin or ethereum.

## The Speculative Attack Playbook


Not every project is suitable for a speculative attack. Let's go over some of the criteria you should look for in a target:

#### Overvalued
The project has an excessively high FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation), now it's important to remember that the circuilating market cap is not the same as the FDV. The FDV is the market cap if all the tokens were in circulation. This is important because it gives you an idea of the potential dilution that could happen in the future. Not only that, if VCs and founders were to sell their tokens today, they are getting the FDV, not the market cap. This is why it's important to look at the FDV, and not just the market cap. The FDV is the true valuation of the project.

#### Weak Utility

The project has little to no real utility. It's all hype and no substance. It's important to look at the project's use case, and see if it has any real-world applications. You need to ask yourself, could this be done without a token? If the answer is yes, then the project is probably dead in the water.

Here are some common utlity red flags to look out for:
- Used for governance
- Used for voting
- Used for securing the network
- Used for incentivizing users

Even if the project uses the token for all of these things (as they often do), it doesn't mean it has utility.

#### Money Market Availability

The project is listed on a money market that allows you to short it. This is crucial. If you can't short the project, you can't launch a speculative attack. This alone eliminates 95% of the projects in the crypto space. Most projects are not listed on money markets, and even if they are, they are not liquid enough to short. Brownie points if the token can be used as collateral on a money market since many founders and VCs will be using their tokens as collateral to borrow against in order to avoid selling their tokens.

## The Speculative Attack Process

1. Identify the target
2. Research the target
3. Short the target

## Remember

Firstly, sell the tokens on a DEX, this is important because you want to remove sticky liquidity from the project which can induce fear in the markets. 

Secondly, don't short via perpetual swaps, this is because you are not actually removing liquidity from the project, you are just betting on the price. This is why it's important to short on a money market, where you are actually removing liquidity from the project.

Lastly, don't overleverage. This is a high-risk play, and you could lose everything. My advice is to never go above 2.5x leverage, and to only use a small percentage of your portfolio. You can double down if you are already in profit, but don't go all in initially.
