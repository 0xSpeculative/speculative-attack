## Introduction

Welcome, fellow short sellers! You’ve stumbled upon the ultimate guide for those who see the crypto world for what it is—a mix of promise, peril, and a whole lot of pretenders. This is your tactical manual for engaging in the art of speculative attacks against over-valued crypto projects. 

## Disclaimer ⚠️
Before we dive into the rabbit hole, let’s get one thing straight: This guide is not financial advice, legal advice, or even life advice. If you lose your shirt, house, or sanity, that’s on you.


### Speculative Attack Project Tracker

| **Name** | **Overvalued Ratio** | **Market Cap (USD)** | **Counter Party Risk (1-10)** | **Hype Level (1-10)** | **Red Flags** | **Final Verdict** |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| [Akash](./projects/akash)       | 18x                 | $998M                        | 3                                 | 8                     | Weak Utility | High Risk         |


You can use this table as a guide to analyze and track multiple projects, making it easier to identify the most overvalued and risky ones to potentially target for a speculative attack.

## What is a Speculative Attack? 
A speculative attack is like a high-stakes poker game where you’re betting that the other player is bluffing. In the crypto space, this means identifying overvalued projects that are more smoke than substance, and strategically positioning yourself to profit from their inevitable downfall. It’s not for the faint of heart, but then again, neither is crypto.

Why Target Bad Projects? 💣
Because they’re bad! But seriously, the crypto space is rife with projects that are all bark and no byte. From vaporware to outright scams, these projects often attract gullible investors with flashy websites and empty promises. By launching a speculative attack, you’re not just potentially making a profit—you’re doing the community a favor by bringing down the bad apples.

## Tools of the Trade 🛠️
### 1. Research, Research, Research 🧐

Arm yourself with knowledge. Dig deep into whitepapers (or lack thereof), scrutinize team backgrounds, and read between the lines of marketing jargon. If something smells fishy, it probably is.

### 2. Tokenomic analysis 🕵️‍♀️

Tracking unlocks, distributions, inflation, and yields can tell you more about the projects future valuation than any whitepaper.

### 3. Technical Analysis 📈

Charts don’t lie (most of the time). Look for overbought conditions, unnatural price movements, and other red flags that suggest a bubble waiting to burst.

## Tactics for Launching a Speculative Attack ⚔️
### 1. Short Selling

The classic move. If the project is listed on an exchange that allows shorting, this is your bread and butter. Bet against the project and profit as it plummets. Remember you must do this on a money market to actualy remove liquidity of their token. Secondly, beware of the counterparty risk you're taking when bridging, and using money markets.

### 2. Token Dumping

Got bags of a bad token? Short and dump.


Happy hunting! 🎯
